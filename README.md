# Simple Letter Frequency Analyzer

A simple Python program that counts letters and words in text and creates charts.

## What it does:
- Counts how many times each letter appears in your text
- Counts how many times each word appears
- Shows the results in easy-to-read charts
- Gives you a summary of the analysis

## How to use:

### 1. Install Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the program:
```bash
python simple_letter_analyzer.py
```

### 3. Enter your text when prompted, or just press Enter to use sample text

## What you'll learn:

### Python Concepts:
- **Functions**: Breaking code into reusable pieces
- **Dictionaries**: Storing and counting data
- **Loops**: Going through text character by character
- **String methods**: Working with text
- **Collections**: Using Counter for easy counting

### Statistics Concepts:
- **Frequency**: How often something happens
- **Data visualization**: Making charts to see patterns
